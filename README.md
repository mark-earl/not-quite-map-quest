## Introduction
This program demonstrates Dijkstra's path-finding algorithm.

"Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a popular algorithm for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph. It was conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956."

In our application:
- Vertices are cities
- Edges are routes between cities
- Weights are the distances between cities
